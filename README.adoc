[[README for contacts_spring_init]]


This code is based on the spring-boot_react tutorial and guide
https://spring.io/guides/tutorials/react-and-spring-data-rest/

Along with the spring.io blog: https://spring.io/blog/2015/09/01/react-js-and-spring-data-rest-part-1-basic-features
and infoq article https://www.infoq.com/articles/boot-microservices

To reduce boilerplate I have used Lombak as suggested when running http://start.spring.io to build a starter project.


== To install the database in Postgres 

NOTE: Out of the box the system will run a h2database for unit and integration testing at build time.

In psql as root run the following commands:

CREATE USER contacts_spring_init;
ALTER USER contacts_spring_init SUPERUSER CREATEDB;
CREATE DATABASE contacts_spring_init;

WARNING: This creates a user 'contacts_spring_init' with superuser privileges 
-- should be changed in production.
